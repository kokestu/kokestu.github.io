Five years ago, I resolved to start reading again. For a couple of years, I worked up my "reading muscles", resolving to read a little bit every day -- even one sentence would do. Since then, I've aimed to read progressively more books each year. This year, I've read 55 books so far. They've been a mixture of fiction and non-fiction, some prose, some poetry, and some graphic fiction. Here, I give a short list of ten of my favourites, and some of the reasons I enjoyed them.

## The Apocryphal Gospels (Penguin Classics)

<div>

The early Christian church produced a huge amount of writings in the several hundred years following Jesus' death. Most of these didn't end up in the recognised scriptural canon, but together they provide insight into the range and breadth of theological approaches taken by early Christians. Some of the "gospels" (a word that is construed broadly here) were considered to have some authority long after many of the others were declared heretical, and as a result there are glimmers here of stories that are visible in medieval art, as well as the traditions of Islam (the Qu'ran relates a story about the infant Jesus told in the Infancy Gospel of Thomas). I like editions like "Penguin Classics" which include commentary and notes that help illuminate the texts in context. I'd love to read more early texts of Christianity -- particularly collections that include some of the other texts that didn't make it into the New Testament canon (despite [being seriously considered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_New_Testament_canon)).

## Are You My Mother? (Alison Bechdel)

<div>

This is the second volume of Alison Bechdel's graphic autobiography. Here, she explores her relationship with her mother through the lens of psychotherapy (particularly the ideas of Donald Winnicott). She works through memories of her young adulthood (after the death of her closeted father), as well as paralleling her experiences with those of Winnicott. I think graphic novels are particularly well-suited to memoir as a form (although I'm not sure I can express exactly why). I'd like to read more graphic non-fiction, particularly memoirs.

## Because Internet (Gretchen McCulloch)

<div>
<img src="https://gretchenmcculloch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/because-internet-book-cover-full-size.jpg" width=200 align="left" />
This is a fun and very readable linguistics book about the influence of the internet on language. The author explores the evolution and use of linguistic habits like "l337" speak, as well as the use of emojis and memes. I liked that this book charts the development of the internet as a medium, showing how different linguistic innovations appeared at different times, and how some of them moved into general speech and writing. I'd love to read more books that explore the linguistic development and innovations of niche communities (as the internet once was!).

## The Unlikely Disciple (Kevin Roose)

<div>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lM5jeLyZL._SL1360_.jpg" width=200 align="left" />
This is a book about Kevin Roose (then a aspiring student journalist) who opts to spend a semester at Liberty University -- one of the leading conservative evangelical colleges in the United States. At the time, the president of the university was Jerry Falwell (who was also its founder), perhaps one of the first evangelical culture warriors in the US. In this book, Roose paints a critical but sympathetic portrait of the students at the university, as well as navigating the challenges that undercover journalism posed for him. He was even able to get an interview with Jerry Falwell not long before his death in 2007. I enjoyed other journalistic books that I read this year, like *Say Nothing*. I'd like to read more books that take an extended journalistic look at groups that are secretive, or commonly caricatured -- perhaps the British far right, for example.

## Defusing the Sexuality Debate (Mark Vasey-Saunders)

<div>
<img src="https://g.christianbook.com/dg/product/ingram/f400/063541.jpg" width=200 align="left" />
This book explores the difficulties among Anglicans in working out an approach to human sexuality that will be acceptable across the church. It particularly focuses on a history of what has come to be called the "traditional" teaching on sexuality, its scriptural basis, and room for constructive disagreement. I liked the book because it was written from a standpoint of deliberate ambiguity (the author doesn't stake a position on either side), and gave a sympathetic portrait while also laying out a challenge for reconciliation and compromise. I'd like to read more books on theology, whether on issues that are "political", or otherwise.

## I Who Have Never Known Men (Jacqueline Harpman)

<div>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+lTVEy8lL._SL1500_.jpg" width=200 align="left" />
This is a fascinating and genre-defying feminist novel. The imagined world of the story is full of mystery: a group of women are kept in a cage for unclear reasons, until one day things change and they are able to escape into a world apparently devoid of other people. I liked the highly original world of the book, and its effective use of unexplained mystery to draw the reader in. I'd like to read more books that have intriguing and original premises, and that don't fit neatly into genre conventions.

## The Safekeep (Yael Van Der Wouden)

<div>
<img src="https://cdn2.penguin.com.au/covers/original/9780241652305.jpg" width=200 align="left" />
I picked up this book because it was nominated for two prestigious awards, and I liked the sound of the premise. It's a compelling romance story which felt almost timeless, before a twist crashes it into the ground of a very specific time and place. I really liked that it used a complex relationship to explore an important and difficult part of the history of the Netherlands. It does a great job of showing how apparently abstract historical events have a concrete impact on real people's lives. I'd like to read more books that help me to learn about history or ideas through the medium of story.

## The Name of the Rose (Umberto Eco)

<div>
<img src="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~janetmck/bookaweek/books_pics/nameofrose.jpg" width=200 align="left" />
Similarly to *The Safekeep*, this book carried me into a world that I knew very little about -- but this time it was in medieval Europe. The murders are wrapped up in biblical symbolism and set in a context of simmering political tensions in the Catholic Church. I loved the way the story was deeply embedded in the literary environment of 13th century monasticism, and the world-building is fantastic (more books with carefully-mapped labyrinthine libraries please!).

## The Secret of Father Brown (G. K. Chesterton)

<div>
<img src="https://warblerpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Chesterton-Secret-cover-half-scaled.jpg" width=200 align="left" />
I've read several of Chesterton's Father Brown story collections, but I still don't have a paper copy of any of them. In this volume, the Catholic priest-cum-detective takes on a series of nicely-constructed mysteries, making us to rethink our assumptions about motives in the process. I always find Chesterton's work challenging in the best ways, but the cutting moral voice is always nicely tempered by humour and gentleness. I'd like to read more books with compassionate protagonists that offer models of moral authority.

## Klara and the Sun (Kazuo Ishiguro)

<div>
<img src="https://www.rcwlitagency.com/media/7750/klara-and-the-sun.jpg" width=200 align="left" />
Kazuo Ishiguro is perhaps one of my favourite authors (and I have a backlog of his earlier works that I'm currently working through). This book doesn't quite soar to the heights of *Never Let Me Go*, but again I found myself captured by a lead with an entrancing inner life. Klara is an "artificial friend" to a teenage invalid, purchased by her family in an American-tinged alternative universe (future?). Her serious dedication and curiosity drew me in, but her acceptance (or ignorance) of the repugnant parts of her world makes me cautious about the obvious things I'm missing in mine. I'd love to read more creative sci-fi that offers commentary on technology, but not at the expense of compelling personal narrative.
