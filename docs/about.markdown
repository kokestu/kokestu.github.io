I'm Jonathan, an ecology PhD student at King's College London. In my research, I'm interested in understanding how ecology communities assemble and function. I use mathematical models to examine how species interact with one another, and how those interactions change in response to external pressures, like the introduction of non-native species.

Outside of research, I'm interested in philosophy and theology. I'm still working out my perspective on lots of questions around the nature of ethics, mind, and God. I plan to write blog posts about questions that interest me in these areas, and especially where they connect to ideas in ecology!
